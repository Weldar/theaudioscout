These cans provide little to no sound isolation, which means that not only will you hear the world around you, the world will hear you; however they usually have a wider soundstage and most high end headphones typically fall within this category.

<a href="reviews/overclose.html"><b>Over-Ear Closed Back Headphones Reviews</b></a><br>
As one might guess closed back headphones seal you off from the rest of the world and as an added bonus often have a bit fuller bass for you bass-heads out there. Unfortunately closed back headphones in the more budget categories tend to sound muddy.

These are a rare breed of headphones as they don't offer any benefits vs over-open, and are typically less comfortable, but they do exist.

<a href="reviews/onclosed.html"><b>On-Ear Closed Back Headphones Reviews</b></a><br>
This type of headphones are usually your bread and butter when it comes to mobile headphones that have a band. Any pair of cans marketed towards use with your phone on the go usually fit in this category.

<a href="reviews/iem.html"><b>In-Ear Monitors (IEMs)</b></a><br>
IEMs sit in your ear canal and utilizes silicon, rubber, or foam tips to keep itself in your ear and isolate you from outside noise. These are great for those on the go, because they easily fit in your pocket.
