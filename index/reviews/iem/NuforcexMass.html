<h1>Massdrop x Nuforce EDC In-Ear Monitors</h1>
<p>A great value pair of IEMs to get you started.</p> <i><h5>Matt Followell</h5></i>

<br>
<br>

<p>I purchased these IEMs from <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/r/HNKPPF">Massdrop</a> on <i>June 28 2018</i>
 so I have had a decent amount of time to listen to them and get an idea for their sound profile. I have to say for $60 I am quite impressed. </p>

<h3>What is in the Box</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 Braided TRS Cable</li>
  <li>1 Straight TRRS Cable with in-line Mic</li>
  <li>2 Pairs of Large Memory Foam Tips</li>
  <li>3 Pairs of Silicon Tips (Sm, Med, Lrg)</li>
  <li>1 Shirt Clip</li>
  <li>1 Zipper Carrying Case</li>
  <li>2 EDC IEMs (thankfully)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Construction</h3>
These IEMs are made from a solid plastic that is smooth, sits comfortably in my ears, and yet feel very solid without being weighty.
