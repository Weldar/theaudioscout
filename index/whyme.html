<h1>why? WHY? (a rant)</h1>
<p>The reason why I decided to make a text only site about headphones can be traced back to 3 main reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I wanted to work on my knowledge of basic html</li>
  <li>I like buying headphones and comparing them (I'm no pro, just a hobbyist).</li>
  <li>I AM TIRED OF SITES THAT TAKE FUCKING 10 YEARS TO LOAD BECAUSE ALL OF THE DUMB SHIT IN THEM!!</li>
</ol>
<p>Expanding off of item 3. I am cheap, so I have a data plan that limits me to about
1GB of highspeed data before I get the ol diddle and I'm throttled to 128kbps. Then I am stuck for a minute
just waiting for 1 website to load! Enough is enough! Let's take it back to the netscape days of simple sites.
<p>If you are still with me lets go back home so you can read my amateur headphone impressions.</p>
